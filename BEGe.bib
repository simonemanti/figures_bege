  abstract = {We set up a general formalism for models of spontaneous wavefunction collapse with dynamics represented by a stochastic differential equation driven by general Gaussian noises, not necessarily white in time. In particular, we show that the non-Schr\"odinger terms of the equation induce the collapse of the wavefunction to one of the common eigenstates of the collapsing operators, and that the collapse occurs with the correct quantum probabilities. We also develop a perturbation expansion of the solution of the equation with respect to the parameter which sets the strength of the collapse process; such an approximation allows one to compute the leading-order terms for the deviations of the predictions of collapse models with respect to those of standard quantum mechanics. This analysis shows that to leading order, the `imaginary noise' trick can be used for non-white Gaussian noise.},

  abstract = {The performance of a 630 g commercial broad energy germanium (BEGe) detector has been systematically investigated. Energy resolution, linearity, stability vs. high-voltage (HV) bias, thickness and uniformity of dead layers have been measured and found to be excellent. Special attention has been dedicated to the study of the detector response as a function of bias HV. The recommended bias voltage being 3500 V, the detector shows a peculiar behavior for biases around 2000 V: in a narrow range of about 100 V the charge collection is strongly reduced. The detector seems to be composed by two parts: a small volume around the HV contact where charges are efficiently collected as at higher voltage, and a large volume where charges are poorly collected. A qualitative explanation of this behavior is presented. However such a behavior does not affect the expected performance in the normal working conditions, being the detector operated at much higher bias HV than the anomalous region. An event-by-event pulse shape analysis based on A/E (maximum amplitude of the current pulse over the total energy released in the detector) has been applied to events in different energy regions and found very effective in rejecting non localized events. In conclusion, BEGe detectors are excellent candidates for the second phase of GERDA, an experiment devoted to neutrinoless double beta decay of 76Ge.},

In Phase~I of the experiment eight semi-coaxial and five BEGe type detectors have been deployed. The latter type is used in this field of research for the first time. All detectors are made from material with enriched 76Ge fraction. The experimental sensitivity can be improved by analyzing the pulse shape of the detector signals with the aim to reject background events. This paper documents the algorithms developed before the data of Phase~I were unblinded. The double escape peak (DEP) and Compton edge events of 2.615~MeV {$\gamma$} rays from 208Tl decays as well as two-neutrino double beta (2{$\nu\beta\beta$}) decays of 76Ge are used as proxies for 0{$\nu\beta\beta$} decay.},

  abstract = {High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors are powerful detectors for gamma-ray spectroscopy. The sensitivity to low-intensity gamma-ray peaks is often hindered by the presence of Compton continuum distributions, originated by gamma-rays emitted at higher energies. This study explores novel, pulse shape-based, machine learning-assisted techniques to enhance Compton background discrimination in Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe™) detectors. We introduce two machine learning models: an autoencoder-MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). These models differentiate single-site events (SSEs) from multi-site events (MSEs) and train on signal waveforms produced in the detector. The GMM method differs from previous machine learning efforts in that it is fully unsupervised, hence not requiring specific data labelling during the training phase. Being both label-free and simulation-agnostic makes the unsupervised approach particularly advantageous for tasks where realistic, high-fidelity labeling is challenging or where biases introduced by simulated data must be avoided. In our analysis, the full-energy Peak-to-Compton ratio of the \$\$ \textasciicircum\textbraceleft 137\textbraceright\$\$Cs, a radionuclide contained in a cryoconite sample, exhibits an improvement from 0.238 in the original spectrum to 0.547 after the ACM data filtering and 0.414 after the GMM data filtering, demonstrating the effectiveness of these methods. The results also showcase an enhancement in the signal-to-background ratio across many regions of interest, enabling the detection of lower concentrations of radionuclides.},

  abstract = {Quantum mechanics is an extremely successful theory that agrees with every experimental test. However, the principle of linear superposition, a central tenet of the theory, apparently contradicts a commonplace observation: macroscopic objects are never found in a linear superposition of position states. Moreover, the theory does not explain why during a quantum measurement, deterministic evolution is replaced by probabilistic evolution, whose random outcomes obey the Born probability rule. In this article a review is given of an experimentally falsifiable phenomenological proposal, known as continuous spontaneous collapse: a stochastic nonlinear modification of the Schr\"odinger equation, which resolves these problems, while giving the same experimental results as quantum theory in the microscopic regime. Two underlying theories for this phenomenology are reviewed: trace dynamics and gravity-induced collapse. As the macroscopic scale is approached, predictions of this proposal begin to differ appreciably from those of quantum theory and are being confronted by ongoing laboratory experiments that include molecular interferometry and optomechanics. These experiments, which test the validity of linear superposition for large systems, are reviewed here, and their technical challenges, current results, and future prospects summarized. It is likely that over the next two decades or so, these experiments can verify or rule out the proposed stochastic modification of quantum theory.},

This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabeled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labeled datasets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised neural networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training.},

  abstract = {We explore an original strategy for building deep networks, based on stacking layers of denoising autoencoders which are trained locally to denoise corrupted versions of their inputs. The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however shown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error, thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpassing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent SVM classifiers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordinary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the value of using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of useful higher level representations.},

  abstract = {We report on the first search for nuclear recoils from dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with the XENONnT experiment, which is based on a two-phase time projection chamber with a sensitive liquid xenon mass of 5.9 ton. During the (1.09\textpm 0.03) ton yr exposure used for this search, the intrinsic 85Kr and 222Rn concentrations in the liquid target are reduced to unprecedentedly low levels, giving an electronic recoil background rate of (15.8\textpm 1.3) events/ton yr keV in the region of interest. A blind analysis of nuclear recoil events with energies between 3.3 and 60.5 keV finds no significant excess. This leads to a minimum upper limit on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section of 2.58\texttimes 10-47 cm2 for a WIMP mass of 28 GeV/{$c$}2 at 90\% confidence level. Limits for spin-dependent interactions are also provided. Both the limit and the sensitivity for the full range of WIMP masses analyzed here improve on previous results obtained with the XENON1T experiment for the same exposure.},
